# Movie Recommendation Engine

## Overview
The Movie Recommendation Engine is a collaborative filtering-based system designed to provide personalized movie suggestions. Utilizing the MovieLens dataset, this engine analyzes user preferences to recommend movies.

## Setup Instructions

### Ensure Python is Installed
First, make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Cloning the Repository
To set up this project on your local machine, you need to clone the repository. Use the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:jrobin11/MovieRecommendation.git
```

### Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. This keeps your project dependencies separate from your global Python installation. Here's how you can do it:
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to your project directory:
  ```
  cd path/to/your/project
  ```
- Create a virtual environment named `venv` (or any name you prefer):
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  ```
- Activate the virtual environment:
  - On Windows:
    ```
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On macOS and Linux:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Installing Dependencies
With your virtual environment activated, install the required packages using pip and the `requirements.txt` file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and run the main Python script:
```
python main.py
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- PyQt5
- scikit-surprise
